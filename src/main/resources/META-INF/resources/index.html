                <h4>Fire and Emergency Response VR Simulation</h4>
                <p>
                    This was a project I worked on for 2 years during high school. Our local fire department had asked our class of computer science students in the 3rd year, and animation students
                    to create a new training simulation for them. They were currently training using old maps and driving the firetruck around the city. They wanted to do something enjoyable and cheap.
                    Our school created this class through the support of our computer science and animation teachers and began working on it in 2017. When I joined in 2018 I was on the programming team
                    working on the physics of the firetruck, attaching addresses to the locations of houses in the real world locations. That summer my sister and I got the privilage to speak at a convetion in San Diego 
                    for Esri. The next year I became the project lead, I managed all the students and conducted meetings regularly to keep on task. I also managed the file systems and really putting together
                    the project as a whole.

                <p>
                    During the summer of 2020, a few friends and I participated in an international GameJam sponsored by Sogeti, a tech division of
                    Capgemini, sponsored by Intel. The goal of the event was to create a game in 48 hours to promote protecting biodiversity. My team created a game called The Collector
                    and with it we won the caption award "Best Sustainable Code". Our code was described as "precise, clean, and efficient" by the judges.

                <h4>Marketing Information Page</h4>
                <p>
                    In my internship, I was assigned the role of Marketing and Web Development Intern. Most my work consisted of marketing and advertising for trainings from our company. With this, I was able to use my programming skills to develop a comprehensive full-stack webpage within our admin-side infrastructure designed to manipulate and display vital marketing data associated with our multi-media marketing channels. This platform presented cruicial analyitical data including cost, location, advertised trainig, and more. Using this page I created, I was able to begin rolling out weekly reports on the amount of advertisments I sent out, and the total cost of all our advertising efforts to become more cost effective.

                    This is a working project to practice multiple aspects of design I've been learning. 
                    The idea is a Web-Based text adventure written in React.js, css, MongoDB and hosted on AWS where the player could connect to the site and play a randomly 
                    generated game using AI, to create diverse and ever changing worlds and stories as well as responsive and dynamic NPC's.

                <p>
                    This was a project given for my Software Engineering course. The goal was to simulate the SDLC of a product from conception to deployment.
                    The project my team did is a Scheduling Application built in Java using Java Applets and SQL for data storage. The semester finished before the project
                    could be finished in its entierty. The project currently has a functioning calendar, non-functional login page, and basic SQL database connection. I was responsible
                    for writing the code, and managing my team to make sure we were all on track. I also wrote our Architectural Logical View, and our Class Diagram.
                    I also did the final analysis of our code using CodeMR.
